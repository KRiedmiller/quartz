I'm [[kai|Kai]], welcome to my web page and [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

I plan to cultivate mostly bits and snippets of code, maybe there will grow some how-to's and useful scripts at some point. 

# Navigation
- Move through the garden by exploring the graph or following the links on the pages. 
- Get an overview by clicking on [[tags/index|tags]], you'll find
	- [[seedling]] : snippets of code, random bits of information that I might use again at some point.
	- [[evergreen]] : are things I tend to from time to time.
	- Eventually, there might be some [[fruit]] that can be useful for others as well.
